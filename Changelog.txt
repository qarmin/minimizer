2.0.0 - 03.11.2024
- Simplify code related to rules
- Allowed to use different minimization strategies
- Ability to set max time

1.3.1 - 29.10.2024
- Show error when result regressed at the end of minimization

1.3.0 - 23.10.2024
- Added ability to compile app with stable rust
- Added checking time how long command takes
- To output file now is written only broken data, so program can be now stopped in any moment

1.2.1 - 11.08.2024
- Fixed panic `assertion failed: content.len() >= 5`

1.2.0 - 09.08.2024
- Improved algorithm to use later more aggressive minimization which takes more time
- Decreased number of situations when iteration number exceeded limit(it is still possible)
- Improved printed information about current iteration
- Added ability to run custom command to check if produced file is proper
- Optimize checking for less than 5 elements

1.1.0 - 05.08.2024
- New quiet mode, to not print unnecessary information
- Fixed problem with invalid removing content from outside of range instead of inside - this was causing big degradation of time of minimization
- Added special mode for <5 elements, to not fall into removing almost same elements again and again
- Fixed problem with testing same content multiple times(not even 1 item was removed)

1.0.0 - 04.08.2024
- Initial version
