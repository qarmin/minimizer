1.2.0 - 09.08.2024
- Improved algorithm to use later more aggressive minimization which takes more time
- Decreased number of situations when iteration number exceeded limit(it is still possible)
- Improved printed information about current iteration
- Added ability to run custom command to check if produced file is proper
- Optimize checking for less than 5 elements

1.1.0 - 05.08.2024
- New quiet mode, to not print unnecessary information
- Fixed problem with invalid removing content from outside of range instead of inside - this was causing big degradation of time of minimization
- Added special mode for <5 elements, to not fall into removing almost same elements again and again
- Fixed problem with testing same content multiple times(not even 1 item was removed)

1.0.0 - 04.08.2024
- Initial version
